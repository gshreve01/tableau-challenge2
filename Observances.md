I looked at the data and found 3 observances of interest:


1.  The subscriber versus the temporary custeromer
2.  The Peak hours of use in the winter
3.  The age of a person and trip duration

---------------------------------------------------------
For the subscriber versus temporary customer, there was 
an obvious downturn for the subscriber during the 
beginning of the pandemic where people were working from
home.  It seemed at the same time there was a growth in
use of the bicycle service by non-subscribers who may
have had some alternatives such as the subway being closed
removed as an alternative.  Even when subscriber usage 
started to return, temporary usage still continued to 
grow and as an overall percentage has trended up even
as subscriber usage has returned to normal.

------------------------------------------------------------
The peak hours of use is somewhat as a no-brainer.  It peaks
when most people go into work, and when people leave work. 
It seems people may come in at different times, but seem likely
to leave at the same time.  When you look at the graph considering
subscriber or short-term user, the trend is different implying
strongly that the short-term users are not necessarily using it
in association with work related travel.  Although not shown, I
did the same graphs originally for the summer which showed the 
exact same peak hour.

----------------------------------------------------------------
The trip duraton was quite strange and the way it needed to be
filtered removed a lot of the group tied to the duration.  It
does show that the most used time is 5 to 15 minutes which is
probably the length of time someone is willing to bicyle in 
from a location to work.  Another interesting point found is
that for the ages 55 and above that appeared, they were all
subscribers (based on filters).  That implies to me that 
there is a dedication for that generation to contnue from
the younger age group, but to just try it is not what most
of the age 55 and older are willing to risk.
